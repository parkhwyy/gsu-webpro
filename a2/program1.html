    <p><q>The book is magnificent! I have absolutely no idea how anyone could pull so much information and material together into one beautiful package. I spent very little time with it before my wife absconded with it; I know she loves it too! I will get it back at some point. Thanks again, and warm regards.</q> - David</p>
